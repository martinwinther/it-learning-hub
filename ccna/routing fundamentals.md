# Routing Fundamentals

## Overview

Routing is the process by which routers forward IP packets between networks. The term "routing" refers to two different processes: the process by which routers build their routing table (a database of known destinations and how to forward packets toward them) and the process of actually forwarding packets. Understanding routing fundamentals is essential for CCNA certification and network administration.

## How End Hosts Send Packets

### Packet Encapsulation Process

Before examining how routers forward IP packets, we must understand how end hosts send those packets to each other:

#### Frame Encapsulation

- **First Step**: After a host prepares a packet to send to another host, it must encapsulate the packet in a frame
- **Local vs Remote**: If a packet is destined for a host on the same network, there is no need for a router
- **Remote Destinations**: If the packet is for a host outside the network, it must be sent to the default gateway (the router that provides connectivity to other networks)

#### Default Gateway Discovery

- **Manual Configuration**: The sending PC can learn the default gateway through manual configuration
- **DHCP**: The default gateway can be learned through DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
- **Purpose**: The default gateway is the router that provides connectivity to other networks

## The Basics of Routing

### Router Packet Processing

When a router receives a frame destined for its own MAC address, it will:

#### Frame Processing Steps

1. **De-encapsulation**: The router de-encapsulates the frame to examine the packet inside
2. **Destination Check**: If the packet is not destined for the router, it will discard it
3. **IP Address Verification**: If the destination IP is its own IP, it will continue to de-encapsulate
4. **Routing Decision**: If it is not its destination, it will attempt to route the packet to the packet's destination

#### Routing Table Lookup

- **Lookup Process**: The router looks up the packet's destination IP address in its routing table
- **Route Selection**: If a suitable route is found, it will forward the packet according to that route
- **Packet Discard**: If no suitable route is found, it will discard the packet

### The Routing Table

#### Definition and Purpose

A router's routing table is a database of destinations known by the router. It can be thought of as a set of instructions:

- **Route Instructions**: "To send a packet to destination X, forward the packet to next hop Y"
- **Direct Routes**: "If the destination is in a directly connected network, forward the packet directly to the destination"

#### Route Types

The routing table contains different types of routes:

##### Connected Routes (C)

- **Automatic Creation**: Created automatically when an interface is configured with an IP address and enabled
- **Direct Connection**: Represents networks that are directly connected to the router
- **No Configuration Required**: These routes appear without any manual configuration

##### Local Routes (L)

- **Exact IP Address**: A route to the exact IP address configured on the router's interface
- **Automatic Addition**: One local route is automatically added for each interface with an IP address in up/up state
- **32-bit Mask**: Uses a /32 prefix length (255.255.255.255)

##### Static Routes (S)

- **Manual Configuration**: Routes that are manually configured by an administrator
- **Administrative Distance**: Typically have an administrative distance of 1
- **Metric**: Usually have a metric of 0

#### Viewing the Routing Table

##### Basic Commands

- **show ip route**: Displays the complete routing table
- **show ip route | include C**: Shows only connected routes
- **show ip route | include L**: Shows only local routes
- **show ip route | include S**: Shows only static routes

##### Route Information Display

- **Route Codes**: Various codes identify different route types (C, L, S, R, etc.)
- **Gateway of Last Resort**: Indicates whether a default route is configured
- **Subnet Information**: Shows network addresses, subnet masks, and interface information

## Static Route Configuration

### Static Route Types

Static routes can be configured in several ways:

#### Next Hop Routes

- **Command Format**: `ip route destination-network netmask next-hop`
- **Example**: `ip route 192.168.3.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.12.2`
- **Recursive Lookup**: Router must perform a recursive lookup to find the next hop

#### Exit Interface Routes

- **Command Format**: `ip route destination-network netmask exit-interface`
- **Example**: `ip route 192.168.3.0 255.255.255.0 g0/0`
- **Direct Forwarding**: Router can forward directly without recursive lookup

#### Fully Specified Routes

- **Command Format**: `ip route destination-network netmask exit-interface next-hop`
- **Example**: `ip route 192.168.3.0 255.255.255.0 g0/0 192.168.12.2`
- **Best Practice**: Combines exit interface and next hop for optimal performance

### Administrative Distance and Metric

#### Administrative Distance (AD)

- **Purpose**: Indicates the trustworthiness of a route source
- **Static Routes**: Typically have an AD of 1
- **Lower is Better**: Lower AD values are preferred over higher values

#### Metric

- **Purpose**: Indicates the cost to reach a destination
- **Static Routes**: Typically have a metric of 0
- **Route Selection**: Used when multiple routes have the same AD

## Default Routes

### Default Route Definition

A default route is a route to the least-specific destination possible: 0.0.0.0/0

#### Characteristics

- **Matches All Addresses**: This route matches all possible IP addresses from 0.0.0.0 through 255.255.255.255
- **Least Specific**: It is the least-specific route possible
- **Last Resort**: Will only be selected if there aren't any more specific routes in the routing table

### Default Route Configuration

#### Command Syntax

```cisco
Router(config)# ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 next-hop-ip
Router(config)# ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 exit-interface
```

#### Examples

- **Next Hop**: `ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 192.168.1.1`
- **Exit Interface**: `ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 GigabitEthernet0/0`

### Internet Connectivity

#### Purpose

Default routes are commonly used to provide internet connectivity:

- **Gateway of Last Resort**: Points to the internet service provider's router
- **All Traffic**: Routes all unknown destinations to the internet
- **Simplified Configuration**: Reduces the need to configure specific routes for every destination

## Router Forwarding Process

### Forwarding Decision Process

#### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Packet Arrival**: Router receives a frame destined for its MAC address
2. **De-encapsulation**: Removes the frame header to examine the IP packet
3. **Destination Check**: Determines if the packet is destined for the router itself
4. **Routing Table Lookup**: Searches the routing table for a matching route
5. **Route Selection**: Selects the most specific matching route
6. **Packet Forwarding**: Forwards the packet according to the selected route

#### Route Selection Criteria

- **Longest Match**: Most specific route (longest prefix) is selected
- **Administrative Distance**: Lower AD is preferred when routes have same specificity
- **Metric**: Lower metric is preferred when routes have same AD and specificity

### Packet Forwarding Examples

#### Local Network Forwarding

- **Same Subnet**: Packets destined for the same subnet are forwarded directly
- **ARP Process**: Router may need to perform ARP to resolve MAC addresses
- **Direct Delivery**: No routing table lookup required for local destinations

#### Remote Network Forwarding

- **Routing Table Lookup**: Required for all remote destinations
- **Next Hop Resolution**: Router must determine the next hop router
- **Frame Re-encapsulation**: Packet is encapsulated in a new frame for the next hop

## Troubleshooting Routing

### Common Issues

#### No Route to Destination

- **Symptom**: Packets are dropped with "no route to host" error
- **Cause**: No matching route in the routing table
- **Solution**: Configure appropriate static routes or enable dynamic routing

#### Incorrect Next Hop

- **Symptom**: Packets are forwarded but never reach the destination
- **Cause**: Next hop is unreachable or incorrect
- **Solution**: Verify next hop connectivity and correct route configuration

#### Routing Loops

- **Symptom**: Packets circulate indefinitely
- **Cause**: Incorrect route configuration creating circular paths
- **Solution**: Review and correct route configurations

### Troubleshooting Commands

#### Verification Commands

- **show ip route**: Display routing table
- **ping**: Test connectivity to specific destinations
- **traceroute**: Trace the path packets take to reach destinations
- **show ip interface brief**: Verify interface status and IP addresses

#### Debug Commands

- **debug ip packet**: Debug IP packet processing
- **debug ip routing**: Debug routing table updates
- **debug ip icmp**: Debug ICMP messages
