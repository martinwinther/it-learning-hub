# Ansible and Terraform

## Overview

Configuring devices in the CLI is something many network engineers grow to love, but it simply doesn't scale well. As networks grow in size and complexity, the manual, one-by-one configuration of devices makes managing each individual device's configuration infeasible. Not only is configuring each device time-consuming and prone to human error, but tracking configuration changes and enforcing standards across numerous devices becomes unmanageable. Many modern networks require more efficient solutions. In this chapter, we'll cover CCNA exam topic 6.6: Recognize the capabilities of configuration management mechanisms such as Ansible and Terraform. These tools, which embody the principles of infrastructure as code (IaC), play a crucial role in automating and standardizing device configurations, ensuring accuracy and consistency. Automating configuration management tasks is essential in many modern networks, which are increasingly large and complex.

## Configuration Management Fundamentals

### What is Configuration Management?

- **Configuration management** in networking involves various tasks aimed at maintaining, controlling, and documenting the configurations of network devices
- Proper configuration management is important in networks of all sizes but becomes especially critical in larger networks
- Key aspects of configuration management include:
  - Establishing standards
  - Traditional configuration management techniques
  - Maintaining configuration consistency across devices in the network

### Configuration Standards

- Although no two devices in a network will have identical configurations, they also shouldn't be completely unique
- To ensure the security and consistent operations of devices in a network, most elements of a device's configuration can and should be standardized
- Some examples of configurations that can be shared among most or all devices in a network:
  - **DNS servers**: All network devices should use the same DNS servers for consistent name resolution
  - **NTP servers**: To maintain consistent time across all devices in the network, they should query and sync to the same NTP servers
  - **Routing protocols**: Routers should use the same routing protocols with standardized configurations to ensure consistent and efficient routing decisions across the network
  - **QoS policies**: To ensure consistent treatment of different types of traffic, QoS policies should be standardized
  - **AAA servers**: Centralized AAA (RADIUS/TACACS+) servers should be used to control access to network resources and the network devices themselves
  - **Security policies**: Uniform security policies, such as defining which traffic should be permitted or denied, are essential in maintaining a consistent security posture
  - **Logging and monitoring settings**: Syslog messages should be sent to centralized servers to provide a complete and consistent view of network activities. This aids in troubleshooting and security monitoring
- Key configurations like IP addresses and hostnames will vary per device, but standardizing the aforementioned core aspects is vital for managing large-scale environments, maintaining security, and ensuring operational consistency
- Device configurations should be derived from standards, ensuring consistent operations across all devices
- Although each device will have some unique configurations, most should be consistent across devices

### Developing Standards

- Developing these standards involves:
  - Understanding the network's needs
  - Aligning with industry best practices
  - Considering security and performance
  - Involving key stakeholders such as IT security teams, management, server teams, and external consultants or vendors
- Typically, this is a task for more senior staff
- If you're new to networking, your role will likely focus on implementing, operating, and maintaining the network as per these established standards, which are equally important in the network lifecycle

### Configuration Drift

- Maintaining consistent configurations according to organizational standards is essential for the security and reliability of the network
- However, it's common for network configurations to gradually diverge from these standards over time
- This phenomenon is called **configuration drift**, and it can pose significant challenges to network security and operational efficiency
- Configuration drift typically arises from the traditional method of managing network configurations—the manual, device-by-device approach
- Configuring each device individually often leads to inconsistencies due to:
  - Human error
  - Differing interpretations of the standards
  - Small ad hoc configuration changes that accumulate over time

### Problems with Manual Configuration Management

- As networks grow and become more complex, the manual approach proves increasingly inadequate, with implications like the following:
  - **Inconsistency**: Manual configurations can vary slightly from each change, especially when performed by different network admins or engineers. Over time, these small variations can lead to significant inconsistencies across the network
  - **Error-prone**: The manual process is susceptible to human error. A mistyped command or overlooked configuration can create security vulnerabilities or performance problems that may go unnoticed until problems arise
  - **Not scalable**: As the network expands, manually ensuring that every new device or update adheres to the standard configurations becomes infeasible
  - **Difficult to monitor and correct**: Continuously monitoring each device for adherence to configuration standards is challenging. Correcting deviations can be impractical, as it often involves manually checking and adjusting the configurations of each device
- Even with the best of intentions to follow established standards, some degree of configuration drift is almost inevitable when managing a large and complex network manually
- The basic point to remember from this section is that as a network grows in size and complexity, manual configuration management can result in configuration drift, negatively affecting the reliable and secure operation of the network

## Configuration Management Tools

### Configuration Management Tools Overview

- **Configuration management tools** use software to automate various tasks related to configuration management, from deploying initial configurations and configuration changes to enforcing configuration standards
- Device configurations are centrally managed from a server, instead of individually managed on the devices themselves
- Configuring devices with one of these tools generally works by:
  - Configurations are centrally managed from a shared folder
  - A server running a configuration management tool applies configuration changes to devices

### Configuration Templates and Variables

- Device configurations aren't simply stored as is on the server
- Instead, a variety of files are used, each with a different purpose—the types of files and their names depend on the tool
- However, two key elements are:
  - **Configuration templates** that define the desired state of device configurations using a standardized format
  - **Variables** that store specific values unique to each device
- Using the example of two routers with near-identical configurations, a configuration template can be formatted to generate those two separate configurations, replacing the unique per-device configurations with variables
- This single template can be used for all routers that require similar configurations, with a separate file listing the variable values for each router
- By inserting the appropriate values in the configuration template, the server can assemble each device's configuration
- A change to the configuration template or variable files will result in the server applying the changes to the appropriate devices

### Configuration Enforcement

- In addition to configuring devices from a central server, configuration management tools can enforce conformity to the standards defined in the configuration files on the server
- The configuration management server is able to detect any deviations from the standard templates
- It compares the active configuration on a device against the expected configuration as defined by the templates and variables
- This comparison can be scheduled to occur at regular intervals or triggered manually by an administrator
- If a discrepancy is found, the server alerts the administrators, who can then take appropriate action, ensuring that the network remains secure and operates as intended

## Configuration Management Tool Comparison

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

- Ansible, Terraform, Puppet, and Chef are all examples of **infrastructure as code (IaC)**
- Rather than the traditional method of provisioning and managing IT infrastructure through manually configuring servers and network devices, IaC provisions and manages infrastructure through code—configuration files that describe the desired state of the infrastructure and how to configure the available resources to achieve that desired state
- By treating infrastructure as code, organizations can:
  - Version control their infrastructure configurations
  - Apply consistent settings across environments
  - Automate the entire lifecycle of infrastructure provisioning, management, and decommissioning

### Tool Characteristics

- Key details about configuration management tools:
  - **Language**: Programming language each tool is written in
  - **Configuration file format**: Names of key files and file formats used to store configurations
  - **Communication protocol**: Protocol used to communicate with managed devices
  - **Agent-based/agentless**: Agent-based tools require a software "agent" on managed devices, and agentless tools don't
  - **Procedural/declarative**: A procedural approach involves defining a series of steps to configure the target system, and a declarative approach involves defining the desired end state of the system and letting the tool figure out how to achieve that desired state
  - **Push/pull models**: In a push model, the server sends the configuration to the client, while in a pull model the client requests the configuration from the server

## Ansible

### Ansible Overview

- **Ansible** is a configuration management tool that was acquired by Red Hat (the creators of the popular Linux distribution Red Hat Enterprise Linux)
- Ansible itself is written in Python, although most of the files it employs are written in YAML
- One of Ansible's defining features is that it is **agentless**, meaning it doesn't require any special software (an "agent") to run on the managed devices
- Instead, the Ansible **control node**—a server on which you have installed Ansible—uses SSH to connect to managed devices and push configuration changes to them

### Ansible Architecture

- This is called a **push model**; instead of managed devices connecting to and pulling (retrieving) configuration information from the control node, the control node connects to and pushes (sends) configurations to its managed devices
- Ansible primarily uses a **procedural approach**, where you define a sequence of steps or tasks to be executed on the managed devices in a specific order
- Basic Ansible operations:
  - Inventory, template, and variable files define configurations
  - Playbooks define actions
  - The control node uses SSH to connect and push configurations to managed devices

### Push vs Pull Models

- The push model and the pull model each have their own advantages
- The main advantages of a push model are:
  - **Centralized control**: All configuration changes are initiated from the control node
  - **Immediate updates**: If you need to send a critical configuration update to devices, you can configure the changes on the server, which can immediately push the changes to the managed devices
- On the other hand, the pull model tends to distribute the workload across the network, as each managed device independently checks for and applies updates
- However, this can introduce delays, as you have to wait for devices to check in, rather than immediately pushing new configurations from the server
- Neither approach is the correct answer in all situations; it depends on which suits your organization and network

### Ansible Components

- Ansible uses four main types of files:
  - **Inventory**: A file (usually in YAML format) that lists the hosts Ansible manages, optionally organizing them into groups. It can include variables specific to each individual host or group
  - **Template**: Files containing configuration syntax and variables that are processed by Ansible to produce final configuration files for hosts. Templates use the Jinja2 templating language
  - **Variables**: YAML files that list variables and their values. These values are inserted into the templates to create complete configuration files
  - **Playbook**: A YAML file that outlines tasks and procedures to manage configurations on the managed devices defined in the inventory
- Two other key terms:
  - **Module**: A discrete unit of code that can be used by a playbook to perform a specific task. Modules are essentially plugins or components of the Ansible application itself
  - **Task**: A single operation or action as defined in a playbook
- Of the tools we cover in this chapter, Ansible is the one that is most often used for managing network device configurations
- Thanks to Ansible's agentless design, no additional software is required on the managed devices; they just need to accept SSH connections from the control node
- For this reason, Ansible is generally considered the simplest to set up and use to configure your network devices

## Terraform

### Terraform Overview

- **Terraform** is an IaC tool developed by HashiCorp
- Whereas Ansible is primarily focused on configuration management, Terraform is primarily a **provisioning tool**, focused on deploying and provisioning new infrastructure (servers, databases, networks, etc.) rather than managing the configurations of existing infrastructure
- While CCNA exam topic 6.6 refers to Terraform as a configuration management tool, that is typically not its main use case
- While Ansible and Terraform can both perform both roles (provisioning and configuration management), they are sometimes used together to take advantage of the strengths of each: Terraform to provision infrastructure and Ansible to manage its configuration

### Terraform Architecture

- Like Ansible, Terraform uses a push model and also doesn't require a software agent to be installed on the devices it provisions or manages; it takes an agentless approach
- Terraform workflow consists of three main steps:
  1. **Write**: Define the desired state of your infrastructure resources in configuration files using HCL
  2. **Plan**: Verify the changes that will be executed before applying them
  3. **Apply**: Execute the plan to provision and manage the infrastructure resources according to the configuration files

### Terraform Core

- At the heart of Terraform is **Terraform Core**, the central part of Terraform that processes configuration files, manages the state of the infrastructure, and communicates with various providers to provision resources
- Unlike Ansible's procedural approach, Terraform employs a more **declarative approach** in which you define the desired end state for the infrastructure using **configuration files** rather than specifying the step-by-step instructions for how to achieve that desired state
- Terraform Core compares the desired end state defined in the configuration files to the current state in the Terraform **state file** and takes the necessary steps to bring the infrastructure in line with the desired end state

### Terraform Providers

- Terraform Core communicates with various **providers** to provision infrastructure resources
- For example, public cloud providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- It does so via each provider's APIs, allowing Terraform to interact with and manage a wide array of resources
- Beyond public clouds, Terraform also supports:
  - On-premises infrastructure providers such as VMware vSphere and OpenStack
  - Container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes
- Most importantly for a CCNA candidate, Terraform can interact with a variety of Cisco platforms to provision and manage infrastructure
- For example, there are Terraform integrations with:
  - Cisco Catalyst Center
  - Application-Centric Infrastructure (ACI—Cisco's data center automatization solution)
  - IOS XE (a modern version of IOS that is run by many Cisco network devices, such as their Catalyst switches)

### HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL)

- While Terraform itself is written in **Go** (a programming language developed by employees at Google), Terraform defines and provisions infrastructure using a configuration language called **HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL)**
- HCL is an example of a **domain-specific language (DSL)**—a type of computer language that is specialized to a particular purpose (unlike general-purpose languages such as Python and Go)
- The main benefits of a DSL such as HCL stem from its specialization; it's designed specifically for its intended purpose and can often perform complex tasks with much less effort than a general language would require
- However, it does mean you have to learn another language specifically for the purpose of using Terraform, which can be considered a downside

## Puppet and Chef

### Puppet Overview

- **Puppet** and **Chef** are two other prominent IaC tools that, like Ansible, are primarily used for the purpose of configuration management
- Puppet and Chef were both included as topics in version 1.0 of the current CCNA exam (exam code 200-301), but were removed in version 1.1
- However, it is worth taking a brief look at these two tools to compare and contrast them with Ansible and Terraform
- There are two key differences:
  - In contrast to Ansible and Terraform's push model, Puppet and Chef primarily use a **pull model**
  - Whereas Ansible and Terraform use an agentless architecture, Puppet and Chef use an **agent-based** architecture

### Puppet Details

- **Puppet** is an IaC tool for configuration management that is written in the Ruby programming language
- It uses an **agent-based** architecture, meaning that a software agent needs to be installed on each managed device
- Each device's agent periodically connects to a central server, known as the **Puppet master**, to retrieve configuration information
- This is known as a **pull model**. Instead of the management server connecting to managed devices to push configurations, the managed devices connect to the server to pull their configurations
- Like Terraform, Puppet uses a declarative DSL called **Puppet DSL** to define the desired state of the infrastructure
- The Puppet master sends configuration instructions to the agents, which then apply the necessary changes to bring the devices into compliance with the defined state
- Puppet's DSL is known for its simplicity
- While a popular tool for managing the IT infrastructure configuration, its level of adoption is relatively low compared to Ansible when it comes to managing networks; not all network devices support a Puppet agent, so Puppet is often not a viable choice

### Chef Details

- **Chef** is another IaC tool for configuration management that bears some similarity to Puppet
- Like Puppet, Chef is written in the Ruby programming language
- Chef also uses an agent-based approach, requiring a Chef client to be installed on each managed device; this agent connects to the Chef server to pull and apply the latest configurations
- However, unlike Puppet, Chef uses a **procedural approach**
- In Chef, you define a sequence of steps or tasks, known as **recipes**, which outline the specific actions needed to configure the system
- These recipes are grouped into **cookbooks**, which can include additional components such as templates, files, and metadata
- When the Chef client runs, it executes the recipes in the specified order to bring the managed device into the desired state
- Like Puppet, Chef doesn't have the popularity of Ansible in the context of managing networks
- This is likely why Puppet and Chef were removed from the CCNA exam topics list
- However, I recommend knowing their basic characteristics. Specifically, you should understand how a pull model differs from a push model, and the difference between an agentless and agent-based approach

## Choosing a Configuration Management Tool

### Tool Selection Considerations

- We've explored some basic characteristics of these four tools, but which should an organization use?
- The choice depends on the needs of the particular organization
- For example, if an organization's network devices don't support a Puppet or Chef agent, Ansible is the natural choice for configuration management
- But even if device support isn't an issue, the simplicity of Ansible's agentless approach makes it the preferred tool in many networks
- Another key consideration is the operational mode: push or pull?
- Depending on the organization's workflows and specific needs, Ansible may be favored for its push model
- If a pull model is preferred, the choice is between Puppet and Chef
- Of the two, Puppet's declarative nature allows you to define the desired end state without specifying the specific steps to get there
- Chef, on the other hand, takes a procedural approach, which may be preferred for those who want detailed control over the configuration process
- Terraform is primarily used for infrastructure provisioning rather than configuration management
- If your primary need is to deploy infrastructure across various platforms, including cloud and on-premises environments, Terraform's declarative approach and support for different providers make it an excellent choice
- Terraform excels in provisioning complex multi-cloud environments and ensuring that the infrastructure remains consistent and reliable by maintaining the desired state through its configuration files
