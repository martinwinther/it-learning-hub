# Disaster Recovery Planning

## Overview

Disaster recovery (DR) is a subset of business continuity activities designed to restore a business to normal operations as quickly as possible following a disruption. When continuity controls fail, disaster recovery becomes the critical response mechanism to restore operations and minimize business impact.

## Disaster Recovery Planning

### Definition and Scope
Disaster recovery planning encompasses a set of business continuity activities designed to restore a business to normal operations as quickly as possible following a disruption. Disaster recovery plans (DRPs) may include immediate measures to get operations working again temporarily, but the ultimate goal is to get the organization completely back to normal.

### Types of Disasters
Organizations must prepare for various types of disasters:

#### Environmental Disasters
- **Natural Disasters**: Hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, wildfires
- **Weather Events**: Severe storms, extreme temperatures
- **Geographic Hazards**: Volcanic eruptions, tsunamis

#### Technological Failures
- **System Failures**: Hardware malfunctions, software crashes
- **Network Outages**: Connectivity issues, ISP failures
- **Data Center Failures**: Power outages, cooling system failures
- **Cyber Attacks**: Ransomware, DDoS attacks, data breaches

#### Human-Caused Hazards
- **Accidental Damage**: Human error, equipment damage
- **Intentional Acts**: Sabotage, terrorism, vandalism
- **Supply Chain Disruptions**: Vendor failures, transportation issues

## Initial Response

### Containment and Recovery
The initial response focuses on containing the disaster first and then recovering whatever can be immediately restored. This represents a shift from normal business activity to a concentrated effort to restore operations as quickly as possible.

#### Response Priorities
1. **Safety First**: Ensure personnel safety and security
2. **Containment**: Prevent further damage or spread
3. **Assessment**: Evaluate the scope and impact
4. **Immediate Recovery**: Restore critical functions
5. **Communication**: Keep stakeholders informed

### Staffing Considerations
- **Role Flexibility**: Many staff will be working temporary jobs that may be completely different than normal
- **Cross-Training**: Flexibility is key for effective response
- **Advance Planning**: Organizations should plan out duties in advance
- **Team Coordination**: Clear roles and responsibilities during recovery

### Communication Requirements
- **Secure Channels**: Responders must have secure, reliable means to communicate
- **Initial Response**: Communication protocols for immediate response
- **Stakeholder Updates**: Regular updates to management and stakeholders
- **External Communication**: Coordination with emergency services and vendors

## Assessment Phase

### Damage Assessment
The goal is to triage the damage to the organization and implement functional recovery plans. This phase may also include steps to restore temporary operations.

#### Assessment Components
- **Physical Damage**: Evaluate facility and equipment damage
- **System Status**: Assess IT infrastructure and applications
- **Data Integrity**: Verify data availability and integrity
- **Business Impact**: Determine operational impact and priorities

#### Recovery Planning
- **Immediate Actions**: Steps to restore critical functions
- **Temporary Operations**: Interim solutions for business continuity
- **Resource Allocation**: Assign personnel and resources
- **Timeline Development**: Establish recovery milestones

## Disaster Recovery Metrics

### Recovery Time Objective (RTO)
The recovery time objective (RTO) is the targeted amount of time that it will take to restore a service to operation following a disruption.

#### RTO Considerations
- **Business Criticality**: More critical services have shorter RTOs
- **Technical Complexity**: Complex systems may require longer recovery times
- **Resource Availability**: Available personnel and equipment affect recovery speed
- **Cost Implications**: Shorter RTOs typically require more expensive solutions

#### RTO Examples
- **Critical Systems**: 1-4 hours (e.g., payment processing, emergency services)
- **Important Systems**: 4-24 hours (e.g., email, customer service)
- **Non-Critical Systems**: 24-72 hours (e.g., reporting, analytics)

### Recovery Point Objective (RPO)
The recovery point objective (RPO) is the maximum time period from which data may be lost as a result of a disaster.

#### RPO Considerations
- **Data Criticality**: More critical data requires shorter RPOs
- **Backup Frequency**: How often data is backed up affects RPO
- **Data Volume**: Large data sets may require longer backup windows
- **Technology Limitations**: Available backup technologies influence RPO

#### RPO Examples
- **Financial Data**: 0-1 hour (real-time replication)
- **Customer Data**: 1-4 hours (frequent backups)
- **Operational Data**: 4-24 hours (daily backups)
- **Archive Data**: 24+ hours (weekly/monthly backups)

### Recovery Service Level (RSL)
The recovery service level (RSL) is the percentage of a service that must be available during a disaster.

#### RSL Considerations
- **Service Criticality**: Essential services require higher RSLs
- **User Expectations**: Customer and employee needs influence RSL
- **Resource Constraints**: Available resources affect achievable service levels
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Higher RSLs require more investment

#### RSL Examples
- **Mission-Critical**: 99.9% availability (e.g., emergency systems)
- **Business-Critical**: 95-99% availability (e.g., customer-facing systems)
- **Operational**: 90-95% availability (e.g., internal systems)
- **Non-Critical**: 80-90% availability (e.g., reporting systems)

**Important Note**: Disaster recovery efforts conclude only when the organization is back to normal operations in its primary environment.

## Training and Awareness

### Training Requirements
All people involved in a disaster recovery plan should receive periodic training about their role in the plan.

#### Training Components
- **Role Understanding**: Clear understanding of individual responsibilities
- **Procedure Familiarity**: Knowledge of specific recovery procedures

- **New Employee Training**: Training for new staff members

## Backup Strategies

### Critical Role of Backups
Backups are a critical part of disaster recovery. Most businesses are built around their data, making data protection essential for business survival.

### Backup Media Types

#### Tape Backups
- **Characteristics**: Traditional, but commonly used
- **Advantages**: Cost-effective for large volumes, long-term storage
- **Disadvantages**: Difficult to manage, slower recovery times
- **Use Cases**: Long-term archival, compliance requirements

#### Disk Backups
- **Characteristics**: Writes from primary to secondary disk
- **Advantages**: Faster recovery, easier management
- **Disadvantages**: Higher cost, shorter lifespan
- **Use Cases**: Short-term backups, frequent recovery needs
- **Variations**: SAN or NAS storage in separate facilities

#### Cloud Backups
- **Characteristics**: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud
- **Advantages**: Scalable, off-site, managed service
- **Disadvantages**: Ongoing costs, internet dependency
- **Use Cases**: Modern backup strategies, remote workforce

### Backup Types

#### Full Backups
Full backups include everything on the media being backed up. They make a complete copy of the data.

**Characteristics**:
- **Complete Copy**: All data is backed up
- **Independent Recovery**: Can restore from single backup
- **Time and Space**: Requires most time and storage space
- **Frequency**: Typically performed weekly or monthly

**Snapshots**: Snapshots are a form of full backup created using specialized functionality of the hardware platform. For example, snapshotting a virtual system creates a point-in-time copy.

#### Differential Backups
Differential backups supplement full backups and create a copy of only the data that has changed since the last full backup.

**Characteristics**:
- **Incremental Changes**: Only changed data since last full backup
- **Recovery Speed**: Faster than incremental (fewer files to restore)
- **Storage Requirements**: Moderate storage requirements
- **Recovery Process**: Full backup + latest differential backup

#### Incremental Backups
Incremental backups include only those files that have changed since the most recent full or incremental backup.

**Characteristics**:
- **Minimal Changes**: Only files changed since last backup
- **Storage Efficiency**: Takes up less space than differential
- **Recovery Time**: Takes more time to recover (multiple backups needed)
- **Recovery Process**: Full backup + all incremental backups in sequence

**Comparison**: Incremental backups take more time to recover but take up less space than differential backups.

## Disaster Recovery Sites

### Site Types Overview
Organizations maintain three main types of disaster recovery sites to ensure business continuity during disasters.

### Hot Sites
Hot sites are fully operational data centers that have all the equipment and data required to handle operations ready to run.

#### Characteristics
- **Full Operations**: Can instantly be activated and sometimes does so automatically
- **Real-Time Replication**: Data is continuously synchronized
- **Immediate Availability**: Zero or minimal downtime
- **High Cost**: Very expensive to maintain

#### Use Cases
- **Mission-Critical Systems**: Financial trading, emergency services
- **High RTO Requirements**: Systems requiring immediate recovery
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Systems with strict availability requirements

### Cold Sites
Cold sites can restore operations eventually, but they are essentially empty office spaces that require significant investment of time to become operational.

#### Characteristics
- **Empty Facilities**: They have all the infrastructure but not the data or servers
- **Manual Setup**: Requires significant time to configure and populate
- **Cost Effective**: Much less expensive than hot sites
- **Recovery Time**: Can take weeks or months to restore

#### Use Cases
- **Non-Critical Systems**: Systems with longer RTO requirements
- **Budget Constraints**: Organizations with limited disaster recovery budgets
