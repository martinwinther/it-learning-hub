# Threat Identification and Prevention

## Overview

Threat identification and prevention are critical components of cybersecurity that help organizations detect, analyze, and respond to security threats before they can cause significant damage. These systems work together to provide comprehensive protection against various types of cyber threats.

## Antivirus Software

### Purpose and Function
Antivirus software protects against viruses, worms, trojans, and other types of malicious code.

### Detection Mechanisms
Antivirus software uses two different mechanisms:

#### Signature Detection
- **Process**: Looks through a database of known malware patterns and scans files and memory for data matching
- **Advantages**: High accuracy for known threats, low false positives
- **Limitations**: Cannot detect previously unknown attacks
- **Updates**: Requires regular signature updates

#### Behavior Detection
- **Process**: Attempts to model normal activity and then reports when they discover anomalies
- **Location**: Found in endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions
- **Features**: These also feature sandboxing for isolated analysis
- **Advantages**: Can detect unknown threats based on behavior patterns
- **Limitations**: Higher false positive rates

### Modern Antivirus Features
- **Real-Time Protection**: Continuous monitoring of system activity
- **Cloud-Based Analysis**: Leveraging cloud resources for threat analysis
- **Machine Learning**: Using AI to improve detection capabilities
- **Sandboxing**: Isolated execution environments for suspicious files

## Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems

### Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)
Intrusion detection systems monitor an environment for signs of malicious activity and report that activity to administrators.

#### IDS Characteristics
- **Monitoring**: Monitors traffic on the network and searches for signs of malicious traffic
- **Detection**: Identifies potential security threats and attacks
- **Reporting**: Alerts administrators to suspicious activity
- **Passive**: Does not take action to block threats

#### IDS Types
- **Network-Based IDS (NIDS)**: Monitors network traffic
- **Host-Based IDS (HIDS)**: Monitors individual systems
- **Application-Based IDS**: Monitors specific applications

### Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)
Intrusion prevention systems go a step further and attempt to actually block the activity.

#### IPS Characteristics
- **Active Response**: Are like an IDS but can take corrective action in response to threats
- **Blocking**: Like blocking traffic from suspicious sources
- **Real-Time Protection**: Provides immediate threat response
- **Automated Actions**: Can automatically respond to detected threats

#### IPS Actions
- **Traffic Blocking**: Block malicious network traffic
- **Connection Termination**: End suspicious connections
- **Rate Limiting**: Limit traffic from suspicious sources
- **Alert Generation**: Send alerts to administrators

## Environments Monitored

### Host-Based Systems
Host-based intrusion detection and prevention systems monitor and protect individual devices like computers and servers. They analyze the system's files and operations to detect suspicious activities or unauthorized changes.

#### Host-Based IDS (HIDS)

- **Actions**: Can block malicious processes and activities
- **Integration**: Often integrated with endpoint protection platforms
- **Advantages**: Immediate local threat response

### Network-Based Systems
Network-based intrusion detection and prevention systems focus on safeguarding the entire network. They monitor network traffic and analyze packets to detect and prevent malicious activities or intrusions that could harm the network as a whole.

#### Network-Based IDS (NIDS)
- **Scope**: Focuses on safeguarding the entire network
- **Monitoring**: Monitors network traffic and analyzes packets
- **Detection**: Detects malicious activities or intrusions
- **Advantages**: Network-wide visibility and monitoring
- **Deployment**: Typically deployed at network choke points

#### Network-Based IPS (NIPS)
- **Protection**: Protects the network as a whole
- **Actions**: Can block malicious traffic at network level
- **Advantages**: Centralized network protection
- **Use Cases**: Network perimeter protection, internal network monitoring

## Classification Errors

### Error Types
Intrusion systems can make mistakes, with two common types:

#### False Positives
- **Definition**: System incorrectly identifies legitimate activity as malicious
- **Impact**: Can disrupt normal business operations
- **Management**: Requires tuning and adjustment of detection rules
- **Examples**: Legitimate software updates flagged as suspicious

#### False Negatives
- **Definition**: System fails to detect actual malicious activity
- **Impact**: Allows threats to go undetected
- **Risk**: Security breaches and data compromise
- **Examples**: New attack methods not yet in signature databases

### Error Management
- **Tuning**: Regular adjustment of detection parameters
- **Validation**: Manual review of automated decisions
- **Learning**: Continuous improvement based on error analysis
- **Documentation**: Maintain records of false positives and negatives

## Detection Techniques

### Signature Detection
- **Method**: Has a database of malicious patterns of data
- **Limitation**: Cannot detect previously unknown attacks
- **Advantages**: High accuracy for known threats
- **Maintenance**: Requires regular signature updates

### Anomaly Detection
- **Method**: Scans for anomalies in behavior or traffic patterns
- **Advantages**: Can detect unknown threats
- **Challenges**: Higher false positive rates
- **Implementation**: Uses machine learning and statistical analysis

### Additional Detection Methods
- **Heuristic Analysis**: Rule-based analysis of suspicious behavior
- **Machine Learning**: AI-powered threat detection
- **Threat Intelligence**: Integration with external threat feeds
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Analysis of user and system behavior patterns

## Firewalls

### Network Firewalls Overview
Network firewalls serve as the security guards of a network, analyzing all attempts to connect to systems on a network and determining whether the request should be allowed or denied according to the organization's security policy.

### Firewall Architecture
Firewalls have three interfaces:

#### External Interface
- **Connection**: One connects to the internet or another untrusted network
- **Security**: Highest security requirements
- **Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of external traffic
- **Filtering**: Strict filtering of incoming traffic

#### Internal Interface
- **Connection**: Second interface connects to intranet
- **Trust Level**: Higher trust level than external
- **Monitoring**: Monitor internal traffic for threats
- **Policy**: Less restrictive than external interface

#### DMZ Interface
- **Connection**: Third interface connects to the screened subnet, also known as the DMZ
- **Purpose**: Houses publicly accessible services
- **Security**: Intermediate security level
- **Services**: Web servers, email servers, public-facing applications

### Firewall Types
- **Packet Filtering**: Basic packet-level filtering
