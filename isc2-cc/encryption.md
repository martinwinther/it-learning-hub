# Encryption and Cryptography

## Overview

Cryptography is the science of securing information through mathematical operations. Encryption uses mathematical operations to transform information into something unreadable by anyone other than the authorized user. It is a fundamental component of modern cybersecurity and data protection.

## Encryption Fundamentals

### The Encryption Process
Encryption is the process of transforming plaintext information into ciphertext that can't be read by unauthorized individuals. Decryption uses a decryption key to convert ciphertext back into plain text.

#### Plaintext to Ciphertext
- **Plaintext**: The original, readable information
- **Encryption Algorithm**: Mathematical process that transforms plaintext
- **Ciphertext**: The encrypted, unreadable output
- **Key**: Secret value that controls the encryption process

#### Decryption Process
- **Decryption Algorithm**: Mathematical process that reverses encryption
- **Decryption Key**: Secret value that controls the decryption process
- **Plaintext**: The restored, readable information

## Encryption Algorithms

### Overview
There are many different algorithms. Two major categories are symmetric algorithms and asymmetric algorithms. In cryptography, symmetry relates to the keys used for encryption and decryption.

### Symmetric Encryption
Also known as shared secret encryption. The encryption and decryption operations use the same key. Think of it like a password.

#### Characteristics
- **Same Key**: Uses identical key for encryption and decryption
- **Speed**: Faster than asymmetric encryption
- **Key Management**: Requires secure key distribution
- **Examples**: AES, DES, 3DES, Blowfish

#### Key Scaling Problem
- **Two-Way Communication**: Need one key
- **Three-Way Communication**: Need three keys
- **Formula**: n(n-1)/2 keys required for n participants
- **Example**: Organization with 10,000 employees needs almost 50 million keys
- **Challenge**: Each new person generates another 10,000 keys

#### Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
- **Most Common**: AES is the most common symmetric encryption algorithm
- **Standards**: AES-128, AES-192, AES-256
- **Security**: Considered cryptographically secure
- **Applications**: File encryption, disk encryption, secure communications

### Asymmetric Encryption
Solves the scaling problem of symmetric encryption.

#### Key Pair System
- **Public Key**: Can be shared freely, used for encryption
- **Private Key**: Must be kept secret, used for decryption
- **Process**: Encrypt with receiver's public key, decrypt with their private key
- **Requirement**: Keys must be from the same pair

#### Characteristics
- **Slower**: Slower than symmetric encryption
- **Scalability**: Solves the key distribution problem
- **Security**: Based on mathematical problems (factoring, discrete logarithms)
- **Examples**: RSA, ECC, DSA

#### Rivest Shamir Adleman (RSA)
- **Most Common**: RSA is the most common asymmetric encryption algorithm
- **Security**: Based on the difficulty of factoring large prime numbers
- **Applications**: Digital signatures, key exchange, secure communications

## Uses of Encryption

### Overview
Encryption is used to either protect data at rest or to protect data in transit.

### Data at Rest Protection
Encryption can be used to protect data at rest by encrypting individual files or folders. Full-disk encryption (FDE) uses encryption to protect the entire contents of a device.

#### Individual File Encryption
- **Purpose**: Protect specific sensitive files
- **Methods**: File-level encryption, folder encryption
- **Use Cases**: Financial documents, personal information, intellectual property

#### Full-Disk Encryption (FDE)
- **Definition**: Automatically encrypts all data stored on a device
- **Benefits**: Comprehensive protection for entire storage
- **Use Cases**: Laptops, tablets, smartphones, external drives
- **Examples**: BitLocker (Windows), FileVault (macOS), LUKS (Linux)

#### Mobile Device Protection
- **Storage Encryption**: Protects data on mobile devices
- **Hardware Security**: Uses secure enclaves and trusted execution
- **Remote Wipe**: Ability to erase data if device is lost

### Data in Transit Protection
Encryption can be used to protect data in transit by encrypting it as it travels over a network. The HTTPS protocol encrypts web traffic and is a secure alternative to the unencrypted HTTP protocol. Virtual private networks (VPNs) encrypt entire network connections.

#### HTTP vs HTTPS
- **HTTP**: Unencrypted web traffic
- **Risk**: Anyone who observes your network can eavesdrop on your web use
- **HTTPS**: Encrypted web traffic using SSL/TLS
- **Security**: The data is safe from interception

#### Secure Communications
- **Email Encryption**: Protect email messages in transit
- **Mobile Applications**: Secure app-to-server communications
- **Server Communications**: Encrypt data between servers
- **VPN Connections**: Encrypt entire network connections

#### Transport Layer Security (TLS)
- **Purpose**: Secure communications over networks
- **Versions**: TLS 1.2, TLS 1.3 (current standards)
- **Applications**: HTTPS, secure email, VPNs, API communications

## Hash Functions

### Overview
Hash functions are one-way functions that transform a variable-length input into a unique, fixed-length output. They are used in the creation of digital signatures and digital certificates.

### Characteristics
- **One-Way Function**: Cannot be reversed to obtain original input
- **Fixed Output**: Always produces same-length output regardless of input size
- **Deterministic**: Same input always produces same output
- **Collision Resistance**: Two different inputs should never produce the same hash value
- **Avalanche Effect**: Small changes in input produce large changes in output

### Hash Function Properties
- **Variable Input**: Can input any length (two words or entire book)
- **Fixed Output**: Output is always the same length for a given hash function
- **Uniqueness**: Output is unique for each unique input
- **Consistency**: Same input always produces same output

### Common Hash Functions

#### MD5 (Message Digest 5)
- **Creator**: Ron Rivest in 1991
- **Output**: 128-bit hash
- **Status**: NOT considered safe since 2013
- **Use**: Legacy systems, file integrity (non-security critical)

#### SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm)
- **Family**: Multiple versions with different security levels
- **SHA-1**: NOT safe, deprecated
- **SHA-2**: NOT safe, but widely used
- **SHA-3**: SAFE, recommended for new implementations

#### SHA-2 Family
- **SHA-256**: 256-bit output, widely used
- **SHA-512**: 512-bit output, higher security
- **Applications**: Digital signatures, blockchain, file integrity

#### SHA-3 Family
- **Security**: Considered cryptographically secure
- **Design**: Different mathematical approach than SHA-2
- **Recommendation**: Use for new security applications

## Digital Signatures and Certificates

### Digital Signatures
- **Purpose**: Verify authenticity and integrity of digital documents
- **Process**: Hash document, encrypt hash with private key
- **Verification**: Decrypt with public key, compare hashes
- **Benefits**: Non-repudiation, integrity verification

### Digital Certificates
- **Purpose**: Bind public keys to identities
- **Components**: Public key, identity information, digital signature
