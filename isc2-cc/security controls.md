# Security Controls

## Overview

Security controls are safeguards and countermeasures put in place to reduce risk,
detect incidents, or respond to security threats. Organizations implement security
controls to protect information systems, maintain compliance, and achieve specific
security objectives.

These controls may:

- Reduce the likelihood of a threat materializing
- Minimize the impact of an incident
- Detect events in progress
- Support recovery after a security breach

The **control objective** defines what the control is intended to accomplish. For
example, a burglar alarm or security camera helps **detect** intrusions.

## Control Categories

Security controls can be grouped into two key classification models:

---

### 1. **Purpose-Based Categories**

These define the intended outcome or objective of the control.

#### Preventive Controls

- **Purpose**: Stop security incidents from occurring
- **Examples**:
  - Firewalls
  - Access control mechanisms
  - Security policies
- **Use Case**: Prevent unauthorized access to systems

#### Detective Controls

- **Purpose**: Identify and detect threats or security breaches
- **Examples**:
  - Intrusion detection systems (IDS)
  - Security cameras
  - Log monitoring
- **Use Case**: Alert administrators of suspicious activity

#### Recovery Controls

- **Purpose**: Restore systems and data after a security incident
- **Examples**:
  - Backup systems
  - Disaster recovery plans
  - Incident response procedures
- **Use Case**: Recover encrypted data after a ransomware attack

---

### 2. **Mechanism-Based Categories**

These define how the control is implemented.

#### Technical Controls (a.k.a. Logical Controls)

- **Definition**: Technology-based mechanisms
- **Examples**:
  - Firewalls and intrusion prevention systems
  - Antivirus software
  - Encryption
- **Use Case**: Automatically enforce access restrictions or detect malware

#### Administrative Controls

- **Definition**: Policy-driven and process-based safeguards
- **Examples**:
  - Security awareness training
  - Background checks
  - User access reviews
  - Log audits
- **Use Case**: Establish accountability and define acceptable use

#### Physical Controls

- **Definition**: Protect the physical environment
- **Examples**:
  - Door locks
  - Security guards
  - Surveillance cameras
- **Use Case**: Prevent unauthorized physical access to server rooms

## Defense in Depth

**Defense in depth** is a security strategy that uses multiple overlapping
controls to achieve the same objective. This layered approach increases resilience
and reduces the chance of a single point of failure.

- **Example**: A company may use a firewall (preventive technical control), an IDS
  (detective technical control), and security training (administrative control) to
  protect the same resource.

## Summary

Security controls are essential for managing risk and protecting information
assets. Understanding control objectives, categories, and mechanisms helps
organizations build a strong, layered defense.

Key takeaways:

- Controls can be preventive, detective, or recovery-focused
- Controls can be technical, administrative, or physical
- Defense in depth enhances protection through overlapping safeguards
- Proper implementation and monitoring are critical to effectiveness
