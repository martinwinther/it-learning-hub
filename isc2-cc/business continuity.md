# Business Continuity Planning (BCP)

## Overview

Business continuity planning encompasses activities designed to keep a business running in the face of adversity. From small-scale system failures to major disasters like earthquakes or hurricanes, BCP ensures organizational resilience and operational continuity. Also known as COOP (Continuity of Operations Planning), it is a fundamental security concept that supports the CIA triad's availability principle.

## Scope and Planning

### Defining BCP Scope
IT teams can easily become overwhelmed with the multitude of scenarios to protect against. To focus efforts effectively, organizations should ask three key questions:

1. **Which business activities will the plan cover?**
   - Mission-critical functions
   - Revenue-generating processes
   - Customer-facing services
   - Internal operations

2. **What types of systems will the plan cover?**
   - IT infrastructure
   - Applications and databases
   - Network connectivity
   - Cloud services

3. **What types of controls will the plan consider?**
   - Technical controls
   - Administrative controls
   - Physical controls
   - Recovery procedures

### Planning Considerations
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate threats and vulnerabilities
- **Resource Allocation**: Balance protection costs with business impact
- **Stakeholder Involvement**: Include all relevant departments
- **Regular Updates**: Keep plans current with organizational changes

## Business Impact Analysis (BIA)

### BIA Process
The Business Impact Analysis is a systematic impact assessment that begins by identifying the organization's mission-essential functions and then traces those backward to identify the critical IT systems that support those processes.

#### Step 1: Identify Mission-Essential Functions
- **Definition**: Core business activities that must continue during disruptions
- **Examples**:
  - Customer service operations
  - Financial transaction processing
  - Critical manufacturing processes
  - Emergency response systems

#### Step 2: Map Dependencies
- **Process**: Trace backward from business functions to supporting systems
- **Analysis**: Identify critical IT systems, applications, and infrastructure
- **Documentation**: Create dependency maps and system inventories

#### Step 3: Evaluate Risk and Impact
- **Risk Assessment**: Analyze likelihood and potential impact of failures
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Compare protection costs with expected losses
- **Prioritization**: Rank systems by criticality and recovery requirements

### Cloud Environment Considerations
In cloud environments, BCP becomes a collaboration between the provider and customer:
- **Shared Responsibility**: Both parties have continuity obligations
- **Geographic Distribution**: Replicated services across multiple data centers
- **Service Level Agreements**: Define recovery time and recovery point objectives
- **Testing**: Regular disaster recovery testing and validation

## Business Continuity Controls

### Redundancy and Fault Tolerance
Systems should be designed with redundancy and fault tolerance, meaning they are configured so that a single component failure doesn't bring the entire system down.

### Single Point of Failure (SPOF) Analysis

#### Definition
Single point of failure analyses identify places where the failure of one component could cause an entire system or service to become unavailable.

#### Analysis Process
**Example: Web Application Infrastructure**

**Initial State:**
```
Web Server → Firewall → Internet
```

**Step 1: Identify SPOFs**
- Web server is a single point of failure
- **Solution**: Upgrade to web server cluster

**Step 2: Reassess**
```
Web Server Cluster → Firewall → Internet
```
- Firewall becomes the new SPOF
- **Solution**: Implement high availability firewalls

**Step 3: Final State**
```
Web Server Cluster → High Availability Firewalls → Internet
```

**Step 4: Network Redundancy**
- Internal and external network connections remain SPOFs
- **Solution**: Add redundant network connections

#### SPOF Mitigation Strategies
- **Component Redundancy**: Duplicate critical components
- **Geographic Distribution**: Spread systems across locations
- **Diverse Technologies**: Use different vendors and technologies
- **Regular Testing**: Validate redundancy through testing

### Other Continuity Risks

#### Vendor Risks
- **Sudden Bankruptcy**: Vendor financial instability
- **Service Disruption**: Vendor operational failures
- **Mitigation**: Vendor risk assessments, backup providers

#### Capacity Risks
- **Computing Resources**: Insufficient processing power
- **Storage Capacity**: Inadequate storage space
- **Network Bandwidth**: Insufficient connectivity
- **Mitigation**: Capacity planning, scalable architectures

#### Utility Failures
- **Power Outages**: Electrical grid failures
- **Water Supply**: Cooling system failures
- **Internet Connectivity**: ISP failures
- **Mitigation**: Backup utilities, redundant connections

#### Personnel Risks
- **Knowledge Loss**: Departure of key personnel
- **Skills Gap**: Insufficient qualified staff
- **Mitigation**: Succession planning, cross-training, documentation

## High Availability and Fault Tolerance

### High Availability (HA)
High availability uses multiple systems to protect against failures.

#### HA Characteristics
- **Multiple Systems**: Redundant components and systems
- **Automatic Failover**: Seamless transition during failures
- **Load Distribution**: Spread workload across systems
- **Monitoring**: Continuous health monitoring

#### HA Examples
- **Web Server Clusters**: Multiple servers handling requests
- **Firewall Pairs**: Redundant firewall configurations
- **Database Clustering**: Multiple database instances
- **Load Balancers**: Distribute traffic across systems

**Note**: Load balancing is not a goal of high availability. While they often overlap, it is possible to have one without the other.

### Fault Tolerance (FT)
Fault tolerance helps protect a single system from failing in the first place by making it resilient in the face of technical failures.

#### FT Characteristics
- **System Resilience**: Built-in failure resistance
- **Component Redundancy**: Internal redundant components
- **Error Detection**: Automatic error identification
- **Self-Healing**: Automatic recovery mechanisms

## Critical System Components

### The Three Most Likely Failure Points
Three of the components most likely to fail in a computer system are the power supply, storage, and network connection.

#### 1. Power Supplies
- **Failure Risk**: High due to moving parts and electrical stress
- **Impact**: Catastrophic system failure
- **Mitigation Strategies**:
  - **Dual Power Supplies**: Redundant internal power supplies
  - **Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPS)**: Battery backup systems
  - **Power Distribution Units (PDUs)**: Redundant power distribution
  - **Generator Backup**: Long-term power solutions

#### 2. Storage Media
- **Failure Risk**: High due to mechanical components and wear
- **Impact**: Data loss and system unavailability
- **Mitigation Strategies**:
  - **RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks)**:
    - **Disk Mirroring (RAID 1)**: Both disks have identical content
    - **Disk Striping with Parity (RAID 5)**: Three or more disks with parity blocks for data regeneration
  - **Important Note**: RAID is fault tolerance, not backup!
  - **Regular Backups**: Separate backup systems and procedures
  - **Storage Monitoring**: Proactive failure detection

#### 3. Network Connections
- **Failure Risk**: High due to external dependencies
- **Impact**: Loss of connectivity and service access
- **Mitigation Strategies**:
  - **Multiple ISPs**: Redundant internet service providers
  - **NIC Teaming**: Multiple network interface cards
  - **Redundant Connections**: Backup network paths
  - **Load Balancing**: Distribute traffic across connections

### Network Infrastructure Redundancy
Within networks, additional failure points exist:
- **Server-Storage Connections**: Critical for data access
- **Mitigation**: Multipath I/O for redundant connections
- **Network Equipment**: Switches, routers, and firewalls
- **Mitigation**: Redundant network devices and paths

## Redundancy Through Diversity

### Diversity Principles
Avoid having all systems fall victim to the same flaw simultaneously by using different tools from different vendors.

#### Technology Diversity
- **Vendor Diversity**: Use products from multiple vendors
- **Technology Variety**: Implement different technical approaches
- **Cryptographic Diversity**: Use different encryption algorithms
- **Control Diversity**: Implement various security controls

#### Benefits of Diversity
- **Reduced Risk**: Lower probability of simultaneous failures
- **Better Security**: Different vendors have different vulnerabilities
