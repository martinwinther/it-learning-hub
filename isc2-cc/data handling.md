# Data Handling and Lifecycle Management

## Overview

Data handling encompasses understanding how to manage data throughout its lifecycle, from creation to destruction. This includes securely creating, storing, using, sharing, archiving, and ultimately destroying data when it's no longer necessary. The method of destruction should be secure, adhering to standards such as the NIST guidelines for media sanitization.

## Data Lifecycle Management

### Overview
Data must be appropriately managed throughout its life cycleâ€”from creation to destruction. This includes securely creating, storing, using, sharing, archiving, and ultimately destroying data when it's no longer necessary.

### Lifecycle Stages
The data lifecycle follows these key stages:

#### Create
- **Data Generation**: Initial creation of data
- **Classification**: Immediate classification upon creation
- **Security Controls**: Apply appropriate security measures from the start
- **Documentation**: Record creation details and classification

#### Store
- **Secure Storage**: Store data according to classification requirements
- **Access Controls**: Implement appropriate access restrictions
- **Backup**: Create secure backups following retention policies
- **Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of stored data

#### Use
- **Authorized Access**: Only authorized users can access data
- **Usage Tracking**: Monitor how data is being used
- **Security Controls**: Maintain security during data usage
- **Training**: Ensure users understand proper handling procedures

#### Share
- **Controlled Sharing**: Share data only with authorized recipients
- **Secure Transmission**: Use encrypted channels for data sharing
- **Audit Trail**: Maintain records of data sharing activities
- **Recipient Verification**: Verify recipient authorization

#### Archive
- **Retention Policy**: Follow organization's data retention policy
- **Long-term Storage**: Secure storage for archived data
- **Access Controls**: Maintain access controls for archived data
- **Monitoring**: Regular review of archived data

#### Destroy
- **Secure Disposal**: Use secure disposal methods
- **Verification**: Verify complete destruction
- **Documentation**: Document destruction activities
- **Compliance**: Ensure compliance with regulatory requirements

### Important Considerations
- **Not Always Sequential**: Even though it's called a lifecycle, the cycle is not always followed sequentially
- **Not Universal**: Not all stages occur for every type of data
- **Policy Compliance**: Archiving should follow an organization's data retention policy
- **Business Purpose**: Data should generally be destroyed when no longer necessary for legitimate business purposes

## Data Destruction Methods

### Overview
Destruction should take place using a secure disposal method. Should be done in a secure manner so an attacker cannot reconstruct data.

### Electronic Records Destruction

#### NIST Guidelines
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) provides a set of guidelines for secure media sanitization in its Special Publication 800-88. It includes three activities:

##### Clearing
- **Definition**: Writes new data over the old data
- **Level**: Most basic sanitization method
- **Effectiveness**: Effective against most types of casual analysis
- **Use Case**: When media will be reused within the same organization
- **Process**: Overwrite with patterns (zeros, ones, random data)

##### Purging
- **Definition**: Similar to clearing but more advanced and takes longer
- **Methods**: May use cryptographic functions to obscure media on disk
- **Degaussing**: Applies strong magnetic fields to securely overwrite data
- **Effectiveness**: More thorough than clearing
- **Use Case**: When media will be transferred outside the organization

##### Destroying
- **Definition**: Completely destroy the physical media so it's impossible to reconstruct
- **Result**: Cannot be reused
- **Methods**: Physical destruction, incineration, chemical destruction
- **Use Case**: When media contains highly sensitive information
- **Verification**: Visual confirmation of complete destruction

### Paper Records Destruction

#### Shredding
- **Method**: Cuts paper into small pieces
- **Security Level**: Basic security
- **Considerations**: Particle size affects security level
- **Standards**: Follow industry standards for particle size

#### Pulping
- **Method**: Uses chemicals to remove ink and turns paper into pulp for recycling
- **Security Level**: High security
- **Environmental**: Environmentally friendly
- **Process**: Chemical treatment followed by mechanical processing

#### Incineration
- **Method**: Burns paper completely
- **Security Level**: Highest security
- **Environmental**: Not environmentally friendly
- **Use Case**: Highly sensitive documents requiring complete destruction

## Data Classification

### Overview
Data classification is crucial for implementing appropriate security measures. Information should be categorized based on its sensitivity and criticality to the organization. These categories determine the appropriate storage, handling, and access requirements for the data.

### Classification Schemes
Schemes vary, but all try to group information into high, medium, and low sensitivity levels and differentiate between public and private information.

#### Government Classification
- **Top Secret**: Highest level of classification
- **Secret**: High sensitivity information
- **Confidential**: Moderate sensitivity information
- **Unclassified**: Public or low sensitivity information

#### Business Classification
- **Highly Sensitive**: Most critical business information
- **Sensitive**: Important business information
- **Internal**: Internal use only
- **Public**: Information that can be shared publicly

### Classification Criteria
These terms are used to describe how organizations will handle sensitive proprietary and customer data. Organizations that deal with sensitive personal information should consider both the impact on them and the customer.

#### Sensitive Information Types
- **Personally Identifiable Information (PII)**: Names, addresses, social security numbers
- **Financial Information**: Credit cards and bank accounts
- **Health Information**: Especially that governed by HIPAA privacy and security standards
- **Intellectual Property**: Trade secrets, patents, proprietary information
- **Operational Data**: Internal processes, procedures, strategies

### Classification Importance
Classification is extremely important because it dictates the basis for other data security decisions:
- **Access Controls**: Who can access the data
- **Storage Requirements**: Where and how data is stored
- **Transmission Security**: How data is transmitted
- **Retention Periods**: How long data is kept
- **Destruction Methods**: How data is destroyed

## Data Labeling

### Overview
Labeling of classified information should be standardized within an organization. This practice ensures that users can consistently recognize sensitive information and handle it correctly, thereby mitigating the risk of accidental data leaks or breaches.

### Labeling Requirements
When the organization is classifying information, it should also include labeling requirements that consistently apply markings to sensitive information.

#### Standardization
- **Consistent Format**: Use consistent labeling format across the organization
- **Clear Markings**: Make labels easily recognizable
- **Training**: Ensure all users understand label meanings
- **Compliance**: Follow regulatory labeling requirements

#### Label Types
- **Document Headers**: Clear classification markings on documents
- **File Names**: Include classification in file naming conventions
- **Email Headers**: Classification markings in email subject lines
- **Physical Labels**: Labels on physical media and documents
- **Digital Watermarks**: Embedded classification information

#### Label Content
- **Classification Level**: Clear indication of sensitivity level
- **Handling Instructions**: Specific handling requirements
- **Date Information**: Creation and classification dates
- **Author Information**: Who classified the information
- **Review Dates**: When classification should be reviewed
