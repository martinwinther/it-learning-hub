## Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED)

### Overview
The Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) strategy uses design principles to reduce crime and improve security through environmental design.

### The Three Goals of CPTED

#### 1. Natural Surveillance
**Definition**: Facilities designed so employees or passersby can naturally observe what is happening around the facility.

**Implementation**:
- **Appropriate Windows**: Strategic placement for visibility
- **Open Areas**: Clear sight lines around fences and barriers
- **Lighting**: Adequate illumination for visibility
- **Landscaping**: Trimmed vegetation that doesn't obstruct views
- **Building Orientation**: Positioned for maximum visibility

**Benefits**:
- Deters criminal activity through visibility
- Increases likelihood of detection
- Creates sense of community oversight

#### 2. Natural Access Control
**Definition**: Gates and other structures that funnel people into a single point of entry.

**Implementation**:
- **Controlled Entrances**: Limited access points
- **Barriers**: Fences, walls, landscaping that guide movement
- **Signage**: Clear directional guidance
- **Pathways**: Designed routes that control traffic flow
- **Entry Points**: Single, well-controlled access points

**Benefits**:
- Reduces unauthorized access opportunities
- Improves monitoring and control
- Creates clear boundaries

#### 3. Natural Territorial Reinforcement
**Definition**: Make it obvious an area is closed off for public use.

**Implementation**:
- **Signs**: Clear "No Trespassing" and "Authorized Personnel Only" signage
- **Landscaping**: Distinctive design that indicates private property
- **Lighting**: Different lighting schemes for public vs. private areas
- **Architecture**: Building design that clearly defines boundaries
- **Fencing**: Clear physical boundaries

**Benefits**:
- Establishes clear ownership and control
- Deters unauthorized access
- Creates psychological barriers

## Visitor Management

### Visitor Access Controls
Visitor access to sensitive facilities should be carefully controlled with procedures that describe who can authorize visitor access and how visitors can behave in your facilities.

#### Visitor Access Procedures
- **Authorization**: Clear procedures for who can authorize visitor access
- **Escort Requirements**: Who may escort visitors through facilities
- **Behavior Guidelines**: How visitors can behave in facilities
- **Access Limitations**: What areas visitors can and cannot access
- **Duration Limits**: How long visitors can remain on premises

#### Visitor Identification
- **Badge Requirements**: Visitors should wear badges that clearly identify their status
- **Badge Design**: Clearly different from employee badges
- **Information Display**: Visitor name, company, purpose, and expiration
- **Color Coding**: Different colors for different visitor types
- **Return Policy**: Badges must be returned upon departure

#### Visitor Logging
- **Access Recording**: Visitor access should be recorded in a log
- **Information Captured**: Name, company, purpose, escort, time in/out
- **Digital Systems**: Electronic visitor management systems
- **Retention**: Maintain logs for appropriate time period
- **Audit Trail**: Complete record of visitor activities

#### CCTV Considerations
- **Usage**: CCTVs should be used for security monitoring
- **Disclosure**: Needs to be disclosed to visitors
- **Signage**: Clear signs indicating video surveillance
- **Privacy**: Balance security needs with privacy concerns
- **Compliance**: Follow applicable privacy laws and regulations

## Physical Security Personnel

### Security Guards
- **Role**: Human guards help organizations present a welcoming face to the public while maintaining security
- **Appearance**: If you want to show a bolder and more tight security, you can have them wear uniforms
- **Training**: Comprehensive training in security procedures and customer service
- **Authority**: Clear authority and escalation procedures
- **Communication**: Effective communication with visitors and employees

### Security Protocols
Security personnel should follow established protocols for:
- **Access Control**: Verifying credentials and authorizations
- **Incident Response**: Handling security incidents and emergencies
- **Communication**: Coordinating with other security functions
- **Documentation**: Maintaining accurate records and logs
- **Escalation**: Knowing when and how to escalate issues

## Two-Person Security Protocols

### Two-Person Integrity
**Definition**: Two-person integrity requires that two people be present for any access to a sensitive area, such as where valuable items are stored.

**Purpose**:
- **Access Control**: Ensures no single person can access sensitive areas alone
- **Accountability**: Provides witness and verification
- **Deterrence**: Reduces risk of unauthorized access
- **Compliance**: Meets regulatory requirements for sensitive areas

**Implementation**:
- **Access Logging**: Both individuals must sign access logs
- **Simultaneous Presence**: Both must be present during entire access period
- **Verification**: Each person verifies the other's authorization
- **Documentation**: Complete record of access activities

**Use Cases**:
- Evidence storage rooms
