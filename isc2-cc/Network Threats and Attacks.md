# Network Threats and Attacks

## Overview

Network threats and attacks represent significant risks to organizational security
and data integrity. Understanding these threats is essential for cybersecurity
professionals to implement appropriate defenses and respond effectively to security
incidents.

## Malware

### Definition and Components

Malware infects computers and performs some kind of evil action. Malware consists
of two main parts:

- **Propagation Mechanism**: How the malware spreads from one system to another
- **Payload**: The malicious action it performs

### Malware Types and Propagation Methods

Different malware objects spread in different ways. Viruses spread between systems
after a user action; worms spread under their own power; and Trojan horses pose as
beneficial software with a hidden malicious effect.

#### Viruses

- **Propagation**: Spread from system to system based on user action
- **Examples**: Opening infected email attachments, infected USB drives, visiting
  malicious websites
- **Characteristics**: Does not spread unless triggered by user action
- **Best Defense**: User awareness and education
- **Prevention**: Antivirus software, user training, email filtering

#### Worms

- **Propagation**: Spreads without user interaction
- **Characteristics**: Self-replicating, can spread rapidly across networks
- **Examples**: Network worms, email worms, file-sharing worms
- **Best Defense**: Software updates and patches
- **Prevention**: Network segmentation, intrusion detection, patch management

#### Trojan Horses

- **Propagation**: Pretends to be legitimate software
- **Characteristics**: Software works like normal but also contains malicious code
- **Examples**: Fake software updates, malicious applications, compromised
  downloads
- **Best Defense**: Application control and whitelisting
- **Prevention**: Code signing, application allowlisting, user education

### Malware Defense Strategies

- **Layered Defense**: Multiple security controls working together
- **User Training**: Educate users on malware risks and prevention
- **Technical Controls**: Antivirus, firewalls, intrusion detection
- **Process Controls**: Change management, access controls
- **Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring for malware indicators

## Eavesdropping Attacks

### Eavesdropping Overview

Eavesdropping attacks require some compromise of the communication path between a
client and server. These are on-path attacks that intercept communications.

### Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks

In a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack, the attacker tricks the sending system into
communicating with the attacker, rather than the intended server. The user
authenticates to the fake server set up by the attacker, and the attacker acts as
a relay and can view all of the communications that take place between the client
and the server.

#### MitM Attack Methods

- **Network Device Reconfiguration**: Compromising routers, switches, or other
  network equipment
- **DNS Poisoning**: Redirecting DNS queries to malicious servers
- **ARP Poisoning**: Manipulating ARP tables to redirect traffic
- **SSL/TLS Interception**: Intercepting encrypted communications

#### MitM Attack Process

1. **Interception**: Attacker positions themselves between client and server
2. **Redirection**: Client connects to attacker instead of legitimate server
3. **Authentication**: User authenticates to fake server
4. **Relay**: Attacker forwards communications while monitoring them
5. **Data Theft**: Attacker can view, modify, or steal sensitive data

#### MitM Defense Strategies

- **Certificate Validation**: Verify SSL/TLS certificates
- **Network Monitoring**: Monitor for suspicious network activity
- **Encryption**: Use strong encryption for all communications
- **Certificate Pinning**: Pin expected certificates to prevent spoofing

### Man-in-the-Browser Attacks

- **Method**: Attacker compromises the user's browser or extension
- **Location**: Attacker is on the user's computer, not a network device
- **Characteristics**: More difficult to detect than traditional MitM
- **Examples**: Malicious browser extensions, compromised plugins
- **Defense**: Browser security, extension management, user education

### Eavesdropping Prevention

- **Encryption**: Encrypt all sensitive communications
- **Network Security**: Secure network infrastructure
- **Certificate Management**: Proper SSL/TLS certificate management
- **User Awareness**: Train users on secure communication practices
- **Monitoring**: Monitor for suspicious network activity

## Denial of Service Attacks

### DoS Overview

Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks focus on disrupting the use of a system by
overwhelming it with unwanted traffic.

### Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks

Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks send unwanted traffic from a single attacker
system to a victim server, overwhelming it with requests.

#### DoS Attack Characteristics

- **Single Source**: Traffic comes from one attacker system
- **Bandwidth Intensive**: Requires large amounts of bandwidth
- **Easy to Block**: Relatively easy to identify and block
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Overwhelms target system resources

#### Common DoS Attack Types

- **SYN Flood**: Overwhelms server with incomplete connection requests
- **UDP Flood**: Sends large volumes of UDP packets
- **ICMP Flood**: Overwhelms with ping requests
- **HTTP Flood**: Sends excessive HTTP requests
- **Application Layer**: Targets specific application vulnerabilities

#### DoS Attack Cons for Attackers

- **Bandwidth Requirements**: Requires large amounts of bandwidth
- **Easy Detection**: Easy to identify and block
- **Limited Impact**: Single source attacks are less effective
- **Traceability**: Easier to trace back to attacker

### Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) Attacks

Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks use a botnet to send the traffic from
many different sources.

#### DDoS Attack Characteristics

- **Multiple Sources**: Traffic comes from many compromised systems
- **Botnet Usage**: Uses botnets consisting of compromised systems worldwide
- **Alleviates Cons**: Overcomes limitations of single-source attacks
- **Difficult Defense**: More challenging to defend against

#### DDoS Attack Process

1. **Botnet Creation**: Compromise multiple systems to create botnet
2. **Command and Control**: Attacker controls botnet from central location
3. **Attack Launch**: Botnet systems simultaneously attack target
4. **Resource Exhaustion**: Target system becomes overwhelmed
5. **Service Disruption**: Target becomes unavailable to legitimate users

#### DDoS Defense Strategies

- **ISP Assistance**: Defenders might need help from ISP
- **Third-Party Protection**: Use third-party DDoS protection services
- **Traffic Filtering**: Implement traffic filtering and rate limiting
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute traffic across multiple servers
- **Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring for attack indicators

### DDoS Protection Services

- **Cloud-Based Protection**: Services like Cloudflare, AWS Shield
- **ISP-Level Protection**: Network-level DDoS mitigation
- **On-Premises Solutions**: Local DDoS protection appliances
- **Hybrid Approaches**: Combination of multiple protection methods

## Side Channel Attacks

### Side Channel Overview

Side channel attacks monitor system activities and retrieve information that is
actively being used.

### Side Channel Attack Methods

- **Timing Attacks**: Measure how long operations take to complete
- **Power Analysis**: Monitor power consumption during operations
- **Electromagnetic Analysis**: Capture electromagnetic emissions
- **Cache Attacks**: Exploit CPU cache behavior

### Timing Attacks

A timing attack is an example of a side channel attack. The attacker measures how
long a cryptographic operation takes to complete and may use the information to
undermine its security.

#### Timing Attack Process

1. **Measurement**: Attacker measures time for cryptographic operations
2. **Analysis**: Correlates timing with different inputs
3. **Inference**: Uses timing differences to infer secret information
4. **Exploitation**: Uses inferred information to break security

#### Timing Attack Examples
