# Incident Response Planning

## Overview

Incident response is a systematic approach to handling and managing security incidents. Organizations must develop comprehensive incident response programs to effectively detect, respond to, and recover from security incidents while minimizing damage and ensuring business continuity.

## NIST Incident Response Process

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) endorses a four-stage incident response process that provides a structured approach to handling security incidents. This process is detailed in the NIST Computer Security Incident Handling Guide (NIST SP 800-61).

### The Four Stages

- **Responsibilities**: Employee issues, disciplinary actions
- **Coordination**: Internal communication and policy enforcement

### Team Development Considerations
- **Gap Analysis**: If your team lacks critical capabilities (such as forensic capabilities), consider retaining external providers
- **Regular Collaboration**: Have the team work regularly together; don't wait until an incident occurs to pull everyone together
- **Training**: Regular training and skill development
- **Documentation**: Clear roles and responsibilities

## Incident Communications Plan

### Internal Communication
Incident notification and escalation procedures help ensure that the right people internally know about an incident and gain the right information.

#### Internal Communication Components
- **Notification Procedures**: How incidents are reported internally
- **Escalation Paths**: Who needs to be notified and when
- **Status Updates**: Regular updates to stakeholders
- **Decision Communication**: How decisions are communicated

### External Communications
- **Sensitive Information**: Don't leak sensitive information
- **Legal Requirements**: Likely are not legally required to report to law enforcement
- **Public Disclosure**: If you do report, information may become public
- **Safety Threats**: Always contact law enforcement if there is a threat to safety
- **Legal Obligations**: Contact law enforcement if you have a legal obligation
- **Legal Team Involvement**: Always include legal team in external communications

### Secure Communications
- **Communication Methods**: Not only describe who you will communicate with, but also how
- **Secure Channels**: Have secure communication paths
- **Encryption**: Use secure channels for sensitive communications
- **Access Control**: Limit access to incident information

## Incident Identification and Response

### Security Data Sources
Data is crucial to incident detection. There is a responsibility to collect, analyze, and retain security information.

#### Data Sources
Many sources contribute to incident detection, including:
- **Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems**: Network and host-based detection
- **Firewalls**: Network traffic analysis and filtering
- **Authentication Systems**: Login attempts and access patterns
- **System Integrity Monitors**: File and system change detection
- **Vulnerability Scanners**: Security assessment results
- **System Event Logs**: Operating system and application logs
- **NetFlow Connection Records**: Network traffic analysis
- **Antimalware Packages**: Malware detection and prevention

### Correlating Security Information
Security professionals are responsible for collecting data and log information. Security information and event management (SIEM) systems can help with this.

#### SIEM Systems
Security information and event management (SIEM) systems act as centralized log repository and analysis solutions.

**SIEM Capabilities**:
- **Centralized Logging**: Collect logs from multiple sources
- **Real-Time Analysis**: Detect incidents as they occur
- **Automated Detection**: Detect possible incidents based on rules and algorithms
- **Investigation Support**: Critical centralized information source for investigators
- **Correlation**: Connect events across multiple systems
- **Alerting**: Generate alerts for suspicious activities

**SIEM Benefits**:
- **Comprehensive View**: Single view of security events
- **Automated Analysis**: Reduce manual analysis workload
- **Faster Detection**: Identify incidents more quickly
- **Better Investigation**: Provide context for incident analysis

### Receiving Incident Reports
Most of the time incidents are identified based on internal data. Sometimes those systems fail and we don't hear about an incident until an employee or customer tells us.

#### Report Handling
The incident response team should have a method for receiving, recording, and evaluating these reports.

**Report Process**:
- **Reception**: Clear process for receiving reports
- **Recording**: Document all incident reports
- **Evaluation**: Assess report validity and priority
- **Escalation**: Route reports to appropriate team members
- **Follow-up**: Provide feedback to reporters

## Responding to Incidents

### First Responder Responsibilities
The first member who notices an incident has first responder responsibilities.

#### First Responder Actions
- **Quick Response**: Should act quickly to contain damage
- **System Quarantine**: May have to quarantine the system by removing it from the network
- **Evidence Preservation**: Keep systems running to preserve evidence when possible
- **Documentation**: Record all actions taken

### Containment Priority
A first responder's highest priority should be containing the damage by isolating affected systems.

**Containment Strategies**:
- **Network Isolation**: Disconnect affected systems from the network
- **Service Disabling**: Stop affected services
- **Access Restrictions**: Limit access to affected systems
- **Traffic Filtering**: Block malicious traffic
- **System Quarantine**: Isolate systems for analysis

### Threat Intelligence Integration
Integrate your incident response capabilities with your threat intelligence program.

**Integration Benefits**:
- **Proactive Detection**: Identify threats before they become incidents
- **Context**: Provide context for incident analysis
- **IOC Sharing**: Share indicators of compromise
