## Security and the Shared Responsibility Model

### Overview
The vendor and the customer take responsibility for different elements of security in cloud computing.

### IaaS Responsibility Model
- **Vendor Responsibility**: Security of the data center, physical infrastructure, network infrastructure
- **Customer Responsibility**: Customers configure the software, so that is primarily their responsibility
- **Security Areas**:
  - Vendor: Physical security, network security, hypervisor security
  - Customer: Operating system, applications, data, access controls

### PaaS Responsibility Model
- **Vendor Responsibility**: The vendor is responsible for the operating system
- **Customer Responsibility**: The customer is responsible for the rest of the software
- **Security Areas**:
  - Vendor: Platform security, runtime environment, operating system
  - Customer: Application security, data security, access controls

### SaaS Responsibility Model
- **Vendor Responsibility**: Vendor manages almost everything
- **Customer Responsibility**: Customer just needs to know what data is stored in the service and apply appropriate access controls
- **Security Areas**:
  - Vendor: Application security, data security, infrastructure security
  - Customer: Access controls, data classification, user management

## Automation and Orchestration

### Overview
Automation and orchestration improve the efficiency of managing cloud resources. A common approach to this is the use of an infrastructure as code (IaC) model to script the creation and configuration of cloud resources.

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- **Definition**: The administrator should never build or manage resources with the command line or GUI but instead write code that performs those actions for them
- **Benefits**:
